# STORI-Analysis

## misSTORI.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook is designed to demonstrate the general concepts behind "misSTORI" (1), which is an extension of the STORI (Selective Temporal Overview of Resonant Ions) methodology (2).  There are various ways to run Jupyter notebooks.  Perhaps the most straightforward is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  The Python in the notebook itself relies on the numpy, scipy and matplotlib packages, which will be installed automatically as part of Anaconda.
